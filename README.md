When the UE4 version of AGR is out, this respository will be updating straight to it. However, a final version of the Unity version for Unity 5 will be pushed for those who do not have UE4. I'm also very busy at college at the moment so development is slow, sorry about that!

## Welcome to AGR2280!
AGR2280 is a Wipeout fangame that looks to keep the original modern Wipeout formula alive while expanding on key gameplay elements. At the moment development is closed until Unity 5 is released so don't expect this repostory to update until then. I want the first milestone of AGR2280 to be something very special that Wipeout fanatics alike can test and really help shape the game, and to do this I first want a solid physics engine...and a good physically based shading model.

## Physics
The biggest role in AGR2280's development is physics. All of the design stuff can come later, my main focus is getting the physics perfect so that the design of the game can just fit with that physics model to create a smooth playing game. This might take a while and I'm always interested in people who want to start helping develop ideas and assets, so feel free to contact me if you want to help in that regard!

## System Requirements ( The current stuff, that can't be suggested yet)

Since there's nothing specific right now, here's a list of fundemental system requirements:

* A processor, preferably one with multiple cores.
* A GPU, preferably one that is not a chip on the motherboard.
* RAM, preferably an amount that is more then nothing.
* An operating system that functions, for now any version of Windows that's not below Windows XP
* A keyboard and/or a gamepad that works, it might be hard to play if these are broken.
* A display, preferably one that works

## System Requirements ( UE4's requirements )

* Windows 7 64-bit | Mac OSX 10.9.2 or later
* Dual Core Intel/AMD Processor, 2.5Ghz or faster
* DX11 compatible GPU
* 8GB RAM
