## Welcome to AGR2280!

AGR2280 is an open source Wipeout fangame that I started with the closure of Studio Liverpool as my attempt to keep Wipeout alive. It's my first serious project and my goal is for the game to be nothing short of the true Wipeout experience. It's obviously going to be free and if you want to help with the actual game itself as apposed to just playing it and/or making your own project then contact me and I'll be happy for you to join in!
