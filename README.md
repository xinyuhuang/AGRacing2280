## Welcome to AGR2280!

AGR2280 is an open source Wipeout fangame that I started with the closure of Studio Liverpool as my attempt to keep Wipeout alive. It's my first serious project and my goal is for the game to be nothing short of the true Wipeout experience. It's obviously going to be free and if you want to help with the actual game itself as apposed to just playing it and/or making your own project then contact me and I'll be happy for you to join in!

## System Requirements

Since there's nothing specific right now, here's a list of fundemental system requirements:

* A processor, preferably one with multiple cores.
* A GPU, preferably one that is not a chip on the motherboard.
* RAM, preferably an amount that is more then nothing.
* An operating system that functions, for now any version of Windows that's not below Windows XP
* A keyboard and/or a gamepad that works, it might be hard to play if these are broken.
* A display, preferably one that works
