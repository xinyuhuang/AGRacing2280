## Welcome to AGR2280!

AGR2280 is an open source Wipeout fangame that I started with the closure of Studio Liverpool as my attempt to keep Wipeout alive. It's my first serious project and my goal is for the game to be nothing short of the true Wipeout experience. It's obviously going to be free and if you want to help with the actual game itself as apposed to just playing it and/or making your own project then contact me and I'll be happy for you to join in!

#### Doing the physics right
No matter how inaccurate my physics are; I will not give up on making sure the physics are tight, fun and most of, to a Wipeout HD standard. AGR2280 has been in development for years because of this, but I am dedicated enough to the project that I don't care how long it takes before I'm happy to get everything else in place. Also it's a great learning curve to understanding physics and game development in general.

#### Open Source standards
I decided to make AGR2280 open source because why hog my progress to myself? I believe that this should be free for everyone to pick up on and extend to make their own games based on what I already have. Because of this, there are specific standards that I stick too to make sure that the tools to help you develop with the project are easy and intuitive. Starting with the release of 0.1, the entire repository will be wiped and replaced with a whole new system that will very rapidly be evolved to help making content much less painful.
